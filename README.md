# My To Do List App with Jetpack Compose

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my personal project â€“ a To-Do List app designed with simplicity and productivity in mind. I built this app using Jetpack Compose for Android. Below, I've highlighted the key features and technologies that went into creating this app.

## Features:
- **User-Friendly Interface:**  Enjoy a clean and intuitive UI designed to make task management a breeze, with an edge-to-edge design for a visually immersive experience.
- **Task CRUD Operations:** Easily add, edit, and remove tasks to keep your to-do list up-to-date.
- **List Management:** Create personalized lists with tasks, and effortlessly add, edit, and remove lists for better organization.
- **Custom Backgrounds:** Personalize each list by changing its background, allowing you to create a visually appealing and organized task environment.
- **Default Lists:** Benefit from two default lists, "My Day" for tasks with a daily deadline and "Tasks" for general, timeless tasks. Uncompleted tasks from "My Day" automatically move to the "Tasks" list at the end of the day.
- **Effortless Task Completion:** Quickly mark tasks as complete with a simple tap, adding a satisfying touch to your productivity.
- **Adaptive Dark Mode:** Seamlessly switch between light and dark modes based on your Android phone's theme, providing a comfortable and visually pleasing experience.
